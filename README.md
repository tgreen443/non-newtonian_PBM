## Description

This repository provides case and source code for a CFD-PBM (Computational Fluid Dynamics coupled with Population Balance Model) simulation of bubbly flow in a non-Newtonian bubble column.
Key feature: Implementation of a bubble coalescence model in the population balance equation, based on the entire turbulent energy spectrum 

## Compatibility

Compile and run in **OpenFOAM10**

solver :multiphaseEulerFoam
